# Salary tracker for FAC9

I propose that we use a document store with a simple front end to input/output salary information for our FAC cohort. We should start with our cohort but structure the data so other cohorts could potentially use this tool if they choose to.

### Proposed tools (given our cohort's expertise)
- React or is this overkill? Vanilla JS with something like materialise?
- D3 for graphing
- Postgres OR MongoDB
